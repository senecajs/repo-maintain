# Simple Todo List with Seneca Microservices

The Meteor Tutorial app.

Use it to share a single todo list with your friends. The list updates on everyone's screen in real time, and you can make tasks private if you don't want others to see them.

This works in conjunction with the SenecaMicroService: https://github.com/Kenny4444/senecaMicroService.

This is also trying to implement Meteor with Seneca as seen here on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FDWv0BDKtI

# Seneca Boilerplate

A working Seneca Microservice example with Express.

## Goals 

- Understand how Seneca works (pattern-matching concept)
- Understand how to create scalable microservices with Seneca. In one of the articles I read, Seneca can help minimize the `technical debt` and scale your application.
- Understand how testing can be integrated with Seneca

# TODO:
- Add a more valid example

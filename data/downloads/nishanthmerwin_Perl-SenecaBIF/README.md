### Purpose

The goal of this repository is to share and save the work I've done through this introductory course on Perl, in the context of bioinformatics. Note that these are simply my own notes and programs that I have written myself, and are not comprehensive in terms of the content taught. However, the programs written do provide some reference for learning.

Note: I will only be posting solutions to assignments and tests once the course has completed.

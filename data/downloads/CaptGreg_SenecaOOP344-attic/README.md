This folder contains a lot of short code fragments and some short test programs.

Some of this code came off the web, most compile, some do not, some I modified, some I made compile, and some I wrote.

No guarantee that any of it works or is useful.

Milage varies:-
   Where the code is short brief, elegant, and concise, it likely will be useful.

   If the code is convoluted, overly complex, or it is unclear what problem it is solving, then it is less useful.

   The Unix philosophy is make things short so you know they work.

Enjoy!
